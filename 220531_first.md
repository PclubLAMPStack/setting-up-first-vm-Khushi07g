# Setting up the virtual machine

1) I downloaded UTM from its website on my mac.
2) Then i installed Ubuntu iso file from https://ubuntu.com .
3) I opened UTM and clicked on the "+" button to create a new virtual machine and selected "Emulate".
4) Then I selected "Linux" as the operating system type and "Ubuntu" as the operating system version.
5) I uploaded the installed ubuntu iso file and alotted 4 GB RAM and default CPU and size of the machine. 
6) I clicked on the "Create" button to create the virtual machine.
7) Then I  started the virtual machine and clicked on install ubuntu.
8) Once the installation was complete, i opened terminal on the virtual machine and typed the following commands to remove the GUI:-
`sudo systemcti set-default multi-user.target`
then i used `sudo reboot` to restart the virtual machine with the new default target.

After the virtual machine started, the GUI was not there and only command line interface was accessible.
